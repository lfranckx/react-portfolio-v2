            <h3>A little more about me...</h3>
            I am a full-stack React and Node.js developer with a background in music and music technology.   I take pride in having a self-disciplined practice, as well as the idea of being humbled by new challenges.   Outside of the world of coding I love seeking adventure in the outdoors whether it be surfing, climbing, or visiting places for the first time.   I want the opportunity to be around experienced developers in order to keep growing, face new challenges, and to be a part of the bigger picture of a product I fully believe in.   Feel free to contact me or browse my projects.
